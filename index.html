        <h2 class="work">Work Experiences</h2>
        <p class="work"> I have worked as a park maintaner for the majority of my time. I have been called a key worker in the park as I helped to win a war between the rival parks. My boss has said many great things about my work. I can lift over 300+ of weight, run for miles without tiring, and I'm able to maintain golf carts.</p>
        <p class="work">I was also a famous bodybuilder for 2 years of my life.</p>
        <h2 class="About">About Me </h2>
        <p class="About">I am the best at everything. I am the best husband to ever exist, I am a best friend to a ghost who has a hand for a head (Who else can say that?), and you know who else is the best at everything? My mom!
            A man as perfect as I also tend to have hobbies to entertain me. Especially the sport of basketball. The reason for my interest in basketball is because I tend to use the sport as a tie-breaker between me and my fellow coworkers when we try to figure out who will be able to use the computer. In the process of said game, the god of basketball came down and allowed us to master the art which is <a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_blank"> basketball.</a> </p>
